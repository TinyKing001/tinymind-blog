Trading in the stock market is like being in a Monopoly game. If there are ten people playing, one person is likely to take everyone else’s money.
股票市场交易就像玩大富翁游戏。如果有十个人在玩，其中有一个人可能会拿走其他所有人的钱。

Trading functions much the same way, with 10% of traders becoming profitable, while the other 90% lose or break even. After studying successful traders from the books by Michael Covel and Jack Schwager for many years, and achieving my own financial freedom from trading the stock market, I have compiled a list of what separates them and their followers from the 90% that come up short.
交易的运作方式大致相同，10% 的交易者获利，而其他 90% 的交易者亏损或收支平衡。在研究了迈克尔·科维尔和杰克·施瓦格书中的成功交易者多年，并通过股票市场交易实现了自己的财务自由之后，我整理了一份清单，列出了他们及其追随者与 90% 失败者之间的区别。
