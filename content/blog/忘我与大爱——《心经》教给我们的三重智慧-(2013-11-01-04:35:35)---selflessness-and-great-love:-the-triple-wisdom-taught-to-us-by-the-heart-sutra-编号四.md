若问浩瀚佛经，哪一部最为提纲挈领，深得释迦摩尼大师的本意，则非《心经》莫数。区区260字，已然挑明人世间迷悟根本。
If you ask the vast Buddhist scriptures, which one is the most outlined and grasped, and the original intention of Master Shakyamuni is not the "Heart Sutra". is only 260 words, which has already pointed out the root of the world's confusion.

   然而，世人多痴迷不悟，万中无一能懂此经，非不懂文字，而是字字皆懂，唯不懂涵义，见字忘义，所谓后世高僧不得不著文字，便是这个道理。究其原因，绝不是世人愚笨，相反，乃是年轻人太过聪明，你我皆如此，年轻气盛，得到些成就便自以为聪明了得，不知道大道如此简单，也不愿相信大道如此垂手可得，总以为心中的大道，一定高深莫测，足令自己一闻即五体投地的拜服。故此，世人放下明月，一心一意去追求那个指月的手指头，最后，历经苦难，受尽波折，撞到南墙，方才醒悟，无奈，这时已经是满身疮疤鲜血淋漓，人世界成熟之路的残忍与无奈，尽在于此。
However, the world is obsessed with many people do not understand, none of the ten thousand can understand this scripture, not do not understand the text, but understand every word, but do not understand the meaning, see the word and forget the meaning, the so-called later generations of monks have to write words, is this truth. The reason is not that the world is stupid, on the contrary, it is that young people are too smart, you and I are like this, young and vigorous, and when we get some achievements, we think we are smart, I don't know that the avenue is so simple, and I don't want to believe that the avenue is so accessible. Therefore, the world put down the bright moon and wholeheartedly pursued the finger that pointed to the moon, and finally, after suffering, suffered all the twists and turns, and hit the south wall, only to wake up, helpless, at this time it was already full of scars and blood, and the cruelty and helplessness of the road to maturity in the human world all lie in this.

   人世界更可怜的，更多人，活到死，还痴迷不悟，七八十岁，尚受无名之火煎熬，来世投生，了无慧根，一切又要从头开始。
The human world is more pitiful, more people, living to death, still obsessed, seventy or eighty years old, still suffering from nameless fire, reincarnated in the next life, without wisdom, everything has to start from scratch.

   一幅《心经》，万人读诵，万种境界，所谓一曲老歌，18岁唱来一种感悟，38岁唱来，另一种感悟，也具这个道理。
A "Heart Sutra", read and recited by 10,000 people, 10,000 realms, the so-called old song, 18-year-old singing to a kind of understanding, 38-year-old singing, another kind of understanding, also has this truth.

   一读《心经》，大部分人可以得到“空”的道理，认识到《心经》是教人放空自己，看开一切的。认识到这是菩萨教育人要放下执着的，你听，菩萨循循善诱曰：色不异空，空不异色，色即是空，空即是色，受想行识亦复如是。是诸法空相，不增不减，不垢不净，不生不灭。是故，空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法。
After reading the Heart Sutra, most people can get the truth of "emptiness" and realize that the Heart Sutra teaches people to empty themselves and see everything. Realizing that this is the Bodhisattva's teaching people to let go of attachments, you listen, the Bodhisattva follows the good temptation and says: color is not different from emptiness, emptiness is not different from color, color is emptiness, emptiness is color, and the same is true of thinking and acting knowledge. It is the emptiness of all laws, neither increasing nor decreasing, neither impurity nor purity, neither birth nor destruction. Therefore, there is no color in the air, no thoughts, no thoughts, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind, no color, sound, fragrance, and touch.

   然而，一味的五蕴皆空，心无挂碍，这人有人味儿吗？恐怕人类社会便告解体，大家人人拜佛吃斋，何人生产，社会如何进步？佛菩萨，绝不会令人类变成磕头虫，围绕在庙宇里虚耗一生。
However, if the aggregates are empty and the mind is unhindered, does this person have a human taste? I am afraid that human society will disintegrate, everyone worships Buddha and eats fasting, who produces, and how can society progress? Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will never make human beings become kowtowers and waste their lives in temples.

   故此，《心经》的第二重境界，便是告诉我们要“忘我识我”，也即是忘了假我，回归真我。
Therefore, the second realm of the Heart Sutra is to tell us to "forget ourselves and know ourselves", that is, to forget the false self and return to the true self.

   我的灵魂与我，是不同的，一真一假。我的灵魂，就是现在思考的那个我，像一个计算机软件，依托着一台电脑，有电源，导线，键盘，硬盘，CPU，屏幕，等等输入/处理/输出硬件维持着自己的运行，同时管理着电脑硬件。灵魂要运行，周围也要有物质支持，有大脑，有眼耳鼻舌身等输入/输出硬件。我们的身体，构成了一个硬件的壳，盛放着我们的灵魂，隔离开凶险恶劣的外在自然环境，保护着我们的灵魂顺利存在，同时，灵魂也管理肉体，支配着它的运行。
My soul is different from mine, one true and one false. My soul is the one I am thinking about now, like a computer software, relying on a computer, with power supply, wires, keyboard, hard disk, CPU, screen, and other input/processing/output hardware to maintain its own operation, and at the same time manage the computer hardware. The soul must run, and there must be material support around it, a brain, and input/output hardware such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body. Our body constitutes a hardware shell that holds our soul, isolating from the harsh external natural environment, protecting our soul from its smooth existence, and at the same time, the soul also governs the body and governs its operation.

   然而，时间一长，我们的灵魂就把外在的躯壳和感觉也当作自己了，就是真我和假我，混为一谈了，我们区分不出来哪里是真我的界限，哪里是外部躯壳输送过来的信号，我们就像那个软件，它把自己和计算机硬件混为一谈了。
However, over time, our soul takes on the outer shell and the feeling as its own, that is, the true self and the false self, and we can't distinguish where the boundaries of the true self are and where are the signals from the external body, and we are like the software, which confuses itself with the computer hardware.

  计算机一断电，那个软件就很痛苦，因为它不知道，即便断电，软件还在那里存着呢，甚至电脑坏了，换一台新电脑，它一样可以运行的很好，它以为屏幕一黑，自己就完了，于是，计算机软件不允许计算机断电，不想让计算机坏掉。我们是一样的，我们怕死，怕失去，想得到，我们以为，看到的，摸到的，听到的，得到的，才是真的，于是，我们害怕：得不到，已失去，伤别离。
As soon as the computer is powered off, the software is very painful, because it doesn't know, even if the power is off, the software is still there, and even if the computer is broken, change to a new computer, it can run very well, it thinks that the screen is black, and it will be finished, so the computer software does not allow the computer to be powered off, and does not want the computer to break. We are the same, we are afraid of death, we are afraid of losing, we want to get, we think, see, touch, hear, get, is true, so we are afraid: we can't get it, we have lost, we are hurt and separated.

   在现实生活中，如此在无意识的假我中活着，反而把真我因此丢掉的人，不说100%，恐怕也差不多。假我对他人付出，却得不到回报，于是万分痛苦。
In real life, people who live in the unconscious false self and lose their true self because of it, if not 100%, I'm afraid it's about the same. If I give something to others and I don't get anything in return, I feel very miserable.

    你看：  You see:

   一个老婆爱老公，怕失去他，就查他的电话记录，试图控制他的一切，勾心斗角的研究小三的心理和计策，琢磨对策，搞得自己满头白发，心力憔悴，她觉得自己为老公付出了这么多，老公却不珍惜，自己是唯一能为老公操心如是的女人，老公却在外边找不谙世事的小女孩，真是真爱得不到回报，于是痛苦万分。
A wife loves her husband, afraid of losing him, so she checks his phone records, tries to control everything about him, intrigues to study the psychology and strategies of the mistress, ponders countermeasures, and makes herself full of gray hair and haggard, she feels that she has paid so much for her husband, but her husband does not cherish it, she is the only woman who can worry about her husband, but her husband is looking for a little girl who is not familiar with the world outside, and true love is not reciprocated, so she is in great pain.

    你再看：  You look again:

  一个新媳妇怕婚后婆婆关系处理不好，就事先研究各种婆媳之道的教材，备好了防护罩和盾牌。你让她给婆婆买东西送礼这些外物的付出，她倒不心疼，但是你让她花时间陪婆婆，这一涉及“我”，可就如坐针毡了。她从心里没把婆婆当作自己人，付出的很多，得到的回报却不成比例，于是能避则避，从此陷入冷战和痛苦。
A new daughter-in-law is afraid that the relationship between her mother-in-law will not be handled well after marriage, so she studies various teaching materials on the way of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in advance, and prepares protective shields and shields. You asked her to buy things for her mother-in-law and give gifts to her mother-in-law, she didn't feel distressed, but you asked her to spend time with her mother-in-law, which involves "me", but it is like sitting on pins and needles. She didn't treat her mother-in-law as her own person in her heart, she gave a lot, but the rewards she received were disproportionate, so she avoided it, and fell into cold war and pain from then on.

    你看：  You see:

   一个儿子怕背负不孝之名，就花钱买礼物给父母，送过去，父母心疼钱一皱眉，儿子就大呼小叫恶语相对，似乎自己的孝心喂了狗。他没有考虑过，父母需要的，可能只是他来陪一陪自己，聊聊家常，他嫌这样麻烦，涉及他自己“我”的付出时，他即不那么大方了。
A son is afraid of bearing the name of unfilial piety, so he spends money to buy gifts to his parents, and sends them over, and when his parents feel sorry for the money, they frown, and the son shouts and speaks badly, as if his filial piety has fed the dog. He didn't think about it, what his parents needed might just be for him to accompany him and talk about family life, he hated it so troublesome, and when it came to his own "me" contribution, he was not so generous.

    你看：  You see:

   一个已婚成功男人爱上一个女人，必须独占她，明媒正娶不成，便金屋藏娇，使其为自己生儿育女，得到占有的快乐。他说，我什么都给她了，钱，房子，不就是个名分一张纸吗，有那么重要吗？他在涉及外物时，那么大方，一旦涉及到“我”，便找的到各种理由逃避，他爱的不是女人，是自己。
A married and successful man falls in love with a woman, he must monopolize her, and the Ming media can't get married, so he hides the gold house, so that he can have children for himself and get the happiness of possession. He said, I gave her everything, money, house, isn't it just a piece of paper, is it that important? When he involves foreign objects, he is so generous, once it comes to "me", he finds all kinds of reasons to escape, he does not love women, but himself.

    你看：  You see:

   一个女孩爱上一个成功男人，为此不惜苦等，不吝啬做小三的尴尬，只为寻求真爱。可是他却并不愿意跟她结婚，总是找的到理由推脱，女孩痛苦不堪。我都付出了青春美貌，你还这样对我，我恨真爱难寻。可是，如果你真的爱他，你会让他承受抛弃妻子，抛弃儿女，一脚两船的痛苦吗？你的所谓爱情，不过是假我得到一个好的生活和爱情环境的诱惑而已，浪漫的鲜花和奢侈的爱情旅行，是假我得以满足的超级诱惑，以真爱为名，如果他什么都没有，你还会苦等他吗？你恐怕一秒钟也不会在他身上浪费时间吧。两个真我的真爱，是绝不会踏破道德底线的——他会先离婚，她会后等待。
A girl falls in love with a successful man, and she does not hesitate to wait, not stingy with the embarrassment of being a junior, just to find true love. But he didn't want to marry her, and always found a reason to shirk it, and the girl was miserable. I have paid for my youth and beauty, and you still treat me like this, I hate that true love is hard to find. But if you really love him, will you let him suffer the pain of abandoning his wife and children, and abandoning his children? Your so-called love is just the temptation of a good life and love environment for the false self, romantic flowers and extravagant love trips, it is a super temptation for the false self to be satisfied, in the name of true love, if he has nothing, will you wait for him? You're afraid you won't waste a second of your time on him. The true love of two true selves will never break the moral bottom line - he will divorce first, and she will wait later.

    你看：  You see:

   一个妈妈让女儿学钢琴，为此买了最昂贵的琴，请了最专业的教师，可是女儿却不愿意练琴，为此，妈妈砸坏了两只琴了，母女关系一触即发，妈妈为此非常痛苦：我是为了她好，却得到这样的回应，女儿真的不懂事，寒了母亲的心。可是，女儿也是人呢，你自己当年没有成为钢琴家，为什么非要逼迫女儿超过你呢？女儿的成功，究竟是为了她好，还是为了弥补你自己人生缺憾的衍生补偿，如果是后者，你不觉得自私？
A mother let her daughter learn the piano, for which she bought the most expensive piano and hired the most professional teacher, but her daughter was unwilling to practice, for this reason, the mother smashed two pianos, and the mother-daughter relationship was about to erupt, and the mother was very painful for this: I was for her good, but I got such a response, the daughter was really ignorant, and the mother's heart was cold. However, your daughter is also a human being, you yourself didn't become a pianist back then, why do you have to force your daughter to surpass you? Is your daughter's success for her good, or is it a derivative compensation to make up for your own shortcomings in life, and if it's the latter, don't you feel selfish?

   这些我们身边常见的人和事，都伴随着付出却得不到回报的痛苦：我都这样付出了，你还不知珍惜？
These common people and things around us are accompanied by the pain of giving but not getting in return: I have paid like this, and you still don't know how to cherish it?

   核心问题是，小鸭向小鸡付出一条鱼，小鸡不吃有错吗？你的心里只有你自己的时候，即便你付出给了别人，别人也不能感受到快乐。你心里没有自己的时候，你什么也不用给，只要心在别人那里，别人也感受的到快乐。
The core question is, is it wrong for the duckling to give a fish to the chick, and the chick not to eat it? When you only have yourself in your heart, even if you give to others, others will not feel happy. When you don't have yourself in your heart, you don't have to give anything, as long as your heart is in others, others will feel happy.

   因此，我们的人世界，穷人容易快乐，富人反而没有快乐，小孩容易快乐，大人心事重重，社会地位越高，家庭笑声越少。
Therefore, in our human world, the poor are easy to be happy, the rich are not happy, children are easy to be happy, adults are preoccupied, and the higher the social status, the less laughter in the family.

   《心经》第三重，告诉我们，眼耳鼻舌身输入的信号，并不一定是真的，也不一定是假的，不要把他们产生的色声香味触法，当作真我。放开假我后的人的真我，都是息息相通的。甚至人与宇宙万物，都是相连的。我们这时放下感受，放下感觉，只用真心与人相处，与动物相处，与自然相处，就有快乐，便是欢喜。人死了，动物死了，植物死了，我们的灵魂，如会溪流入海，迟早都是会归为一体的。因此，宏观看，长远看，甚至你和你最不共戴天的仇人，其实也是一个大事物的两个部分，你们迟早会合体为一。懂得了这个，你还恨的起来吗？你恨谁都是恨自己，杀谁都是杀自己，爱谁都是爱自己，这就是万物是我，我是万物，大慈悲，大智慧的《心经》第三重境界。
The third part of the Heart Sutra tells us that the signals input from the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body are not necessarily true or false, and we should not regard the colors, sounds, fragrances, and touches they produce as the true self. The true self of the person who lets go of the false self is all connected. Even human beings are connected to everything in the universe. At this time, we let go of our feelings, let go of our feelings, and only get along with people, animals, and nature with our sincerity, and then we will be happy, that is, joy. When people die, animals die, plants die, our souls, like streams flowing into the sea, will sooner or later become one. Therefore, in the grand scheme and in the long run, even you and your least discerning enemy are actually two parts of a big thing, and sooner or later you will merge into one. Knowing this, do you still hate it? Whoever you hate is hating yourself, killing anyone is killing yourself, and loving anyone is loving yourself, this is the third realm of the Heart Sutra of all things being me, I am all things, great compassion, and great wisdom.

   佛之智慧，此经皆已蕴含，唯有境界不同，读之感悟的层次不同。愿老王的三重感受，能给各位粉丝一个抛砖引玉的效果，大家结合自己身边的痛苦，想想自己的执着在哪里？为什么放不下，是哪条假我的感受，干扰了自己的真我，使自己执迷不悟。如果能得到第四重，第五重，乃至成就佛智慧的感悟，快与大家分享，共同精进。
The wisdom of the Buddha is already contained in this scripture, but the realm is different, and the level of reading and understanding is different. I hope that Lao Wang's triple feeling can give fans an effect of throwing bricks and attracting jade, and everyone will combine the pain around them and think about where their attachment is? Why can't I let go, which false self is the feeling that interferes with my true self and makes me obsessed. If you can get the fourth, fifth, and even the realization of the wisdom of the Buddha, share it with everyone and make progress together.

   最后，让我们一起来聆听这观自在菩萨的智慧吧：  Finally, let's listen to the wisdom of the Bodhisattva of Freedom:

   观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多时，照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。舍利子，色不异空，空不异色，色即是空，空即是色。受想行识，亦复如是。舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。是故空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法，无眼界，乃至无意识界，无无明，亦无无明尽，乃至无老死，亦无老死尽，无苦集灭道，无智亦无得。以无所得故，菩提萨埵，依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍。无挂碍故，无有恐怖，远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅盘。三世诸佛，依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒。能除一切苦真实不虚，故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰，揭谛揭谛，波罗揭谛，波罗僧揭谛，菩提萨婆诃。
When contemplating the bodhisattva of freedom and walking in the deep prajnaparamita, he sees that the five aggregates are empty and overcomes all suffering. Relics, the color is not different from the emptiness, the emptiness is not different from the color, the color is empty, and the emptiness is the color. The same is true of what you want to do. The relics are the empty phase of all the laws, which are neither born nor destroyed, neither dirty nor pure, nor increased nor decreased. Therefore, there is no color in the air, no thoughts, no thoughts, no knowledge, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind, no color, sound, fragrance, touch, no vision, no consciousness, no ignorance, no ignorance, no old death, no old death, no suffering, no wisdom, and no gain. With nothing to gain, Bodhisattva, according to Prajnaparamita, has no obstacles in his mind. There is no obstacle, no terror, far from upside-down dreams, nirvana. The Buddhas of the three worlds, according to Prajnaparamita, attained the three bodhisattvas of Anuttara. Therefore, it is known that Prajnaparamita is a great mantra, a great mantra, a supreme mantra, and an unequal mantra. It is true that it can get rid of all suffering, so it is said that the Prajnaparamita mantra is said to be mantra, the truth is revealed, the truth is revealed, the truth is revealed, the Buddha monk reveals the truth, and the Bodhisattva Bha.
